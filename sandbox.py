"""This module defines our agent and attaches it to the Modal Stub.

Our agent is defined as a graph: a collection of nodes and edges,
where nodes represent actions and edges represent transitions between actions.

The meat of the logic is therefore in the edges and nodes modules.

We have a very simple "context-stuffing" retrieval approach in the retrieval module.
Replace this with something that retrieves your documentation and adjust the prompts accordingly.

You can test the agent from the command line with `modal run agent.py --question` followed by your query"""
